## 1) Project Titanic
In the next project we plan to use the famous Titanic.csv dataset to 
1) Do a rigorous data analysis
2) To predict based on variables the chance of survival

## 2) Apriori Alghoritm

In this project we applied Apriori Alghoritm to the Bread Basket database to answer the following questions:
1) Which are the most / least purchased products

2) What is the time interval when the shop was having the most purchases

3) What is the "busiest" hour

4) What time of the day records the highest number of purchases

5) What are the association rules between the products
