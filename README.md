## 1) Project Titanic
In the next project we plan to use the famous Titanic.csv dataset to 
1) Do a rigorous data analysis
2) To predict based on variables the chance of survival

## 2) Apriori Alghoritm

In this project we applied Apriori Alghoritm to the Bread Basket database to answer the following questions:
1) Which are the most / least purchased products

2) What is the time interval when the shop was having the most purchases

3) What is the "busiest" hour

4) What time of the day records the highest number of purchases

5) What are the association rules between the products

## 3) Costumer Segmentation

In this project we used K-means and Principal Component Analysis to create costumer groups.

## 4) Fake News Classifier 

Fake news is a big issue of the 21st century. In ancient Athens, fake news spread through the speeches of politicians or sophists. Aristotle solves this problem by laying the foundations of logic. I think it is our duty to do the same, but using more advanced tools. In this project created classification models with the aim to predict and classify fake news.

## 5) Beer Production in Australia forecast for 1996

In this project we used 3 models: Linear Regression, SARIMA and Exponential Smoothing in order to predict the montly beer production in Australia for the year 1996. We used a database with the montly beer production in Australia from 1950 to 1995.

## 6) Age and Gender Classification. Deep Learning Project

In this project I am exploring a dataset from Kaggle that contains images of people of various age and gender. I am creating a single model that returns age and gender in a single pass. I am then using LIME to return the top best/worst predictions. At the same moment I am exploring the ethical considerations of image recognition.
